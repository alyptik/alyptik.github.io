a silly little thing that make the world a little bit simpler&lt;br&gt;
a silly little thing that keeps you from drowning in your own existence&lt;br&gt;
as the dusk kills the day.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;music is just a silly little thing&lt;br&gt;
that makes everything so much more&lt;br&gt;
well&lt;br&gt;
more.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s hard not to sigh in relief of myself as the applause slowly dies down&lt;br&gt;
the rhythmic popping of dusty vinyl quietly gives birth to mahler symphony no. 5&lt;br&gt;
proud trumpets dancing with timid clarinets&lt;br&gt;
ornery cymbals brawling with apathetic euphoniums&lt;br&gt;
myriad strings brashly trying to outdo one another&lt;br&gt;
bass and snare stoically humming sweet nothings to no one in particular&lt;br&gt;
cacophonous harmonies of major 7ths flirting with diminished 4ths&lt;br&gt;
the breathy staccatos of movement no. 1 “trauermarsch”&lt;br&gt;
a fluid, moving contradiction&lt;br&gt;
beauty calling itself a funeral procession&lt;br&gt;
as it tautologically proves&lt;br&gt;
the world might not be such a bad place after all.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;movement no. 2 gleefully taunts the ignorant american in me&lt;br&gt;
“stürmisch bewegt, mit größter sehemenz” which means&lt;br&gt;
(at least according to the irrefutable wikipedia)&lt;br&gt;
“moving stormily, with the greatest vehemence”&lt;br&gt;
and goddamn, does it ever.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;before i even realize it&lt;br&gt;
movement no. 3 bursts into existence&lt;br&gt;
“scherzo” my god&lt;br&gt;
i don’t even know up from down anymore&lt;br&gt;
trombones smash into the world&lt;br&gt;
woodwinds segue into brass like playing a game of bloody knuckles with cement&lt;br&gt;
there is a sudden raw guffaw of hypnotic trills and canon&lt;br&gt;
it is melting into&lt;br&gt;
something something something&lt;br&gt;
bloody french&lt;br&gt;
fancy jargon is no longer a priority&lt;br&gt;
struggling for breath&lt;br&gt;
scrambling for the words&lt;br&gt;
that could never do it justice.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tick tock tick tock.&lt;br&gt;
where did the last ten minutes go?&lt;br&gt;
my body begs for respite&lt;br&gt;
please, Mahler, please&lt;br&gt;
give me a breather you savage bastard&lt;br&gt;
“crescendo. stringendo. accellerando.”&lt;br&gt;
are the only mercies i receive in reply  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then it begins&lt;br&gt;
oh my god&lt;br&gt;
does it fucking begin.&lt;br&gt;
movement no. 4 “adagietto”&lt;br&gt;
in german, “sehr langsam”&lt;br&gt;
an imperative statement, “always slowly”&lt;br&gt;
ha. ha.&lt;br&gt;
as if anyone could make it through this fucking thing&lt;br&gt;
without dying horribly&lt;br&gt;
without loving shamefully&lt;br&gt;
without existing terribly&lt;br&gt;
without being murdered by bits of rapture and fleeting emotions&lt;br&gt;
without being having your sanity consumed by counterpoint and cadence&lt;br&gt;
i no longer care that she forgot about a promise made by two stupid teenagers&lt;br&gt;
i no longer care that i have far too much debts owed to nameless strangers&lt;br&gt;
i no longer care about bridges burnt with regret, back where the water used to be&lt;br&gt;
I don’t know how i ever forgot,&lt;br&gt;
Mahler you beautiful bastard of a cold dead corpse,&lt;br&gt;
how you make me feel so goddamn alive.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;movement no. 5 enters&lt;br&gt;
subtle arpeggios remind me of simpler days&lt;br&gt;
warm doting mothers and cereal soggy with milk&lt;br&gt;
i can never think straight after no. 4&lt;br&gt;
at last, no. 5 “rondo (final)”&lt;br&gt;
Mahler you wonderful fucker&lt;br&gt;
once again you’ve turned me into a quivering wreck of a human being&lt;br&gt;
i wonder why hubris tastes like the ass swig of an old whiskey bottle&lt;br&gt;
i wonder why words only come when everyone else has left&lt;br&gt;
a tired giggling of flutes faintly echoes somewhere&lt;br&gt;
a lonely french horn’s F# fades into the silence of a softer world&lt;br&gt;
a tinge of longing for something you’ve convinced yourself was nothing&lt;br&gt;
it’s funny how those always hurt oh so well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;maybe icarus wasn’t such a sad story after all&lt;br&gt;
just a power outage in the sky&lt;br&gt;
it’s better than complaining to god on hospital floors&lt;br&gt;
angrily coveting the beautiful things we forgot we already are&lt;br&gt;
at least the wax melted&lt;br&gt;
before any of his dreams did.  &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>hello whiskey, my old friend - pt.2</title><link href="https://alyp.tk/hello-whiskey-my-old-friend-pt2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-05T22:16:00-10:00</published><updated>2018-05-05T22:16:00-10:00</updated><author><name>Joey Pabalinas</name></author><id>tag:alyp.tk,2018-05-05:/hello-whiskey-my-old-friend-pt2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello whiskey, my old friend. Yes, yes it's really me. I know it's been quite a while. The words just don't quite come like they used to. It's maddening this world, isn't it? How-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, yes I know. I'm an "adult" now …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello whiskey, my old friend. Yes, yes it's really me. I know it's been quite a while. The words just don't quite come like they used to. It's maddening this world, isn't it? How-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, yes I know. I'm an "adult" now, don't you know? Hah, it feels weird even just saying it. What does it matter if I still feel like I'm in high school, right? Twenty-seven years—ah what was the cliche—cold or some-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, no, I am not sad, don't worry, bràthair. I am not stuck in some vertex of ennui, nor depressed nor anything like that. Maybe I don't talk as much as I used to. Maybe I don't quite find the same things funny I did a few years ago. Maybe I have noticed, little by little, that I'm not actually immune to humanity. I am, in fact, not some immortal Peter-Man-Pan-Can-Can't-If-Only-Haha!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I'm actually quite satisfied with my life, broski. I am quite boring now, I admit that I don't go out much anymore.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more of those crazy&lt;br&gt;
all night party holy damn&lt;br&gt;
wow why am I waking up in a&lt;br&gt;
bathtub that is full of blue&lt;br&gt;
Kool-aid but the girl I happen to&lt;br&gt;
like just asked me out ah shoot it&lt;br&gt;
really turns out she just was playing&lt;br&gt;
wing-lady to-oh-god-like I can remember&lt;br&gt;
anymore I'm way way way way way way way way way&lt;br&gt;
WaaaaaaaaaAAaAAAaAAAaAAaAAAAaAAAaaAAaaaAAaaAaayyyyyy&lt;br&gt;
WAY&lt;br&gt;
too drunk to—&lt;br&gt;
god life is great&lt;br&gt;
—nights.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, old friend, haha, no more nights like those. I am trying my best to be an adult now, man stop, haha. I have to be proper, you know. I might land a job if I try hard enough, right? I mean, shoot, that's fair and life is always fair well maybe not but hey what happens happens, right? Maybe I was not the most motivated or the smartest or anything special or really even a little past where the ordinary overflowed somewhere a few years back or but I worked my ass off! Haha, I do-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh god I remember tha-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahaha! Man... where did the years go, huh?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems just yesterday I was some dumb-ass kid who didn't really care about anything. But now look at me, strange right? Sort sort of respectable, an adult-ish creature and I wouldn't be too ashamed at all if I were to die right now. I mean, there are holes and black spots in my soul I wouldn't dare poke, but so what? Being human is grey and you need a bit of black to get the colors just right. Oh man, do y-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, no, no. No whiskey for me tonight. Yes, boring I know. No, really I-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, no, it's not that at all, брат. It's not that I don't miss the fun times we had. Truly, it was great. Living free, the world was our oyster, RIGHT? But. Really, here I am realizing that no, no, the oyster wasn't an oyster at all but just a plastic bottle of something I don't even recognize or want at all anymore.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, lets not dwell on that. I mean, here we are. Years. But alive we are, you and I, bracie. Glad-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh what's that? You met someo-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, is that really the first thing you said to her?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the stars were just pimples in the sky compares to her smile and how when you saw her face there could never be anyone else and that it would be perfect and passionate and rough and soft and how no no no we won't be like those other couples and no no no we are special and no no no you are indescribable and no no no though sometimes my words are sad and trite and cold but you couldn't mean them any harder because God when I see you I can no longer think straight and I stutter because you are beautiful, yet, you have insides fu-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haha, right, right. Sorry for rambling. Well, I am really glad for you. It seems like this time, you were right about all those things. That-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, she really said &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; that back to you?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you were her sun and moon that she would never love you to death only love you alive and that years later even after the terrible break up in some terrible dispute that horribly really was nothing at all that I will still love you quite terribly and how she would keeps all the boxes of birthday cards you handmade her and how she would always keep the box the you made her for the warm sad soul you said saw in hey and although she would never talk about it she still cared but creepy is creepy and love is patient and kind and angry and horrible and although  maybe she might forget for a few years and maybe the stuffed Pikachu will sit in the back of her closet she hasn't forgetten anything and that whatever we are now is what we are but she won't ever forget what we were.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, old friend. You two were made for each-other. Strange how Lady Luck is retired now. But here we are, frater. I do remember love like that. I do remember the end of love like that. But—water under the bridge—as they say, foxes and grapes and whatnot, you know what I mean. Seriously though teina, you lucked out you. I-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah. True.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough of that depressing talk right? I mean, here we are, right? We're alive. You and I somehow, through all of the crazy and all of the boring, yet we somehow haven't crossed our names off on some list in the heavens somewhere or some list in Avicii somewhere or just a grocery list forgotten about years ago or that we haven't ended up as cold, dead corpses; whoever we were, in the end we all end up with nothing but sh-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHOOT, stubbed my toe. Ow, gah. Where was I? Ah, right...  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in our pants. Caveat lector my bror, haha, sorry, this is what happens once I start talki-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, what was that? I seem happier than last time? Well, I am! I-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess that's a good question. But...  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm alive aren't I?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found something I am somewhat good at. Not amazing, but maybe one day if I try, who knows? I have a use, a purpose, a point! What more do I need? I am living every day like well God, if i died? I'd slap him on the back and say, "Thanks for the ride, G-man!" I don't drink much anymore, but I chain-smoke like a motherf-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, yes yes, bad habit I know. I need some vice, though. Sanity and all?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life's not some white, pure, get in get out perfect cupcake!&lt;br&gt;
Life's more like that slab of ribs, that one tequila too much but wow it was fun.&lt;br&gt;
Life's that water-slide that scared the living daylights out of you.&lt;br&gt;
Life's that messy first date where everything kinda sucked but everything was kind perfect.&lt;br&gt;
Life's a bunch of people and places and things and feeling and sounds and music.&lt;br&gt;
Life's a bunch of experiences and tears and joy and laughter and sadness and smiles.&lt;br&gt;
Life's a bunch of words and compliments and insults and laughs and love and songs.&lt;br&gt;
Life's a bunch of things no one can ever remember or forget and THAT'S-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why it's so damned great.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I wake up in the morning and go about my day? Because I damn well want to, of cour-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haha, yes yes, I got a bit excited there, sorry about that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just feel like we haven't talked in a long time, is all.&lt;br&gt;
Maybe the last time was sad.&lt;br&gt;
Maybe I was a little bit pathetic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still, I'm glad I can still call you veli.&lt;br&gt;
Kazoku, like they say in Japan.&lt;br&gt;
C'est la vie. Bloody French.&lt;br&gt;
All those expressions in all those languages I don't actually know but—  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the words...  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—they make me feel something. Music without music.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, funny isn't it? Years later, here I sit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking to whiskey and wine, just another madman who isn't really angry at all-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, I remember last year. Our last conversation didn't end so well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How distraught I was, surrounding by so much genius I couldn't be bothered to read.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"An Odyssey," I said. "An Iliad," I joked, hah. What was the rest? OH, I remember, "Too fu"-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, no wait, let me stop you there. This isn't me anymore at all, tij laug. You know, after I while you realize no one needs any of those silly melodramatics at all.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, because life's not really so bad.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe I feel a bit more boring. Hell, maybe I am a bit more boring, but deep down-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No no, DEEP down. Who am I deep down, 'bruder?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I still afraid of adventure? Not anymore. God, man, living is adventure!&lt;br&gt;
Huckleberry-Finn? Just a name!&lt;br&gt;
Hubris?&lt;br&gt;
Well, you talk about all these flowery word but what are they?&lt;br&gt;
What is hubris without a silly human, dueling Atlantis water pistol in hand, all-in with his life on the line?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the point in pettifog over the name of some car in some street?&lt;br&gt;
Desire? Desire is raw humanity. Desire is not something that belongs to rubber and steel and vinyl and glass.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crime, punishment, these are for us, for the men and women, not mice nor pigs any animals on the whatever farm.&lt;br&gt;
I wasn't alive in 1984, and damned if I remember who Aesop even is anymore.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Names? Names are just words on paper and sounds on lips and they mean nothing without the thing behind it and—look
—God is a word in a book just like any other and Odin is a word as is Hades and Thor and all of them! All of them just words, sometimes ugly sometimes beautiful, but everyone forgets that so is Lot so is Ægir so is Andhrímnir and cooks are a still lovers and cooks are still fighters and Lachesis will still judge your ass whether or not you remember how she &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; fate itself and Hildebrand and Hadubrand who invented the cliffhanger, well dammit, they are as glorious as Hercules even if no one else thinks so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we sit, old hoa.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe we realize that we are not all that shiny or exciting. Who cares if we end up another of Les Misérables? Don't you remember the ending? Jean Valjean died, as do we all. But-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Why do I care?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hah, your memory fails you, ախպեր. Glory and dramatics and action and all of this and all of that and if you don't have life is pointless and God-  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's wrong with &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; wanting that?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe, just maybe, it's not so horrid a mortal sin, so taboo a way of life, to just be me or you or whoever you are or want to be today. What's wrong with a bit of contentment? Life isn't action and gunfight and spies and orgies and car chases and cops and robbers and death and chaos. Life is dull and sharp. Life is alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Jean Valjean died content, did he not?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Why not live like that as well?&lt;/h6&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>on dreams</title><link href="https://alyp.tk/on-dreams.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-23T22:43:00-10:00</published><updated>2017-08-23T22:43:00-10:00</updated><author><name>Joey Pabalinas</name></author><id>tag:alyp.tk,2017-08-23:/on-dreams.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;!-- ![dreams]({filename}/images/dreams.png) --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why do I want to be a programmer? Why do I want to work in software development? Why do I want to spend hours in gdb trying to figure out why my program is segfaulting? Why do I want to spend most of the day reading manpages to figure …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;!-- ![dreams]({filename}/images/dreams.png) --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why do I want to be a programmer? Why do I want to work in software development? Why do I want to spend hours in gdb trying to figure out why my program is segfaulting? Why do I want to spend most of the day reading manpages to figure out library function prototypes? Why do I want to make it nearly a certainty that I will end up with an RSI later in life; some sort of typing related horror that will probably make daily task incredibly annoying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the short and simple answer is &lt;strong&gt;because it's fun&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a joy hacking away at code, dereferencing pointers with reckless abandon, clobbering registers for the fun of it, coming up with ridiculously hacky solutions to problems that would make most normal people swoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really something I love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what makes a good programmer? The answer varies depending on who you ask of course, but ask the grizzled veterans, the ones who used to hack away on TX-01s between classes and build telephone relays to thwart service provider fees, you'll start to see the answers sort of converge; I've eventually learned that these are the ones that warrant your full, undivided attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming is hard. There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it, and really it is not some sort of thing you can do half-heartedly. Attention to detail is incredibly important. You need to be willing to put the work in; when you have a problem you can't solve no matter how hard you throw your brain pan at it, you can't just check stack overflow and copy-paste some snippet call you a programmer. Well, you can, but eventually, your hubris will catch up with you. You'll find yourself stuck way in over your head, and end up quitting and becoming a lumberjack or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, you have to actually want to know the “why”. The internet is great, answers to nearly any problem are right your fingertips, but just using someone else's work and calling it a day will eventually come back to bite you. Googling is fine and dandy, encouraged even, but you have to try to understand “why” this is the solution. By doing so, you not only are bettering your craft, you are building towards something far more important: A foundation for your entire programming career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how some tiny, useless snippet works under-the-hood, say the reason why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;putchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;prints out &lt;code&gt;'o'&lt;/code&gt; may seem useless and unimportant; who would ever need to use something like this in production? But as it turns out, this is a brick in the house you are building. Because you are aware that array indexing is just pointer math:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;when you come across some weirdo problem like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;you are then able to realize you are doing array indexing, and it's the same as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and you end up with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;without having to sort through any incredibly ugly pointer math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now having technical know-how isn't at all the only thing you need to be any good at programming; in fact, it's not even the most important trait to have. Above all, the thing that makes or breaks you is humility. You need to be humble, a person who understands that “I am probably am not some super-prodigy one-in-a-million chosen-by-god programmer who knows everything.” Having the courage to admit that “I probably need to seek out help” every now and then is incontrovertibly the most important characteristic to have; it truly is what defines a professional programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to be humble, as simple as it may seem, is NOT easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are my long-term aspirations? I have no clue. I haven't fully planned out my life apart from a general direction I have pointed myself in, and I don't really feel a pressing need to do so. I just want to be happy, spending my days hacking away at projects that tickle my fancy, creating programs others find useful; everyone wants to make some sort of mark on the world after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do want to be good at my craft, and I will not pretend I am without sin; the sins I have gone over I am guilty of committing far more than a few times. I will not apologize for being human. But I am earnestly working at it. In the end, if I were to ask myself: “Where am I going? What is it I really want to be in this unimaginably huge sea of possibilities?” Well, at this point, the only answer I can give right now would be a simple one, maybe one that would be considered a bit corny by most, but it would be something given in surety:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I just want to be a human being worth a damn.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>on being a fucking adult</title><link href="https://alyp.tk/on-being-a-fucking-adult.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-02T20:06:00-10:00</published><updated>2017-07-02T20:06:00-10:00</updated><author><name>Joey Pabalinas</name></author><id>tag:alyp.tk,2017-07-02:/on-being-a-fucking-adult.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;!-- ![onbeingafuckingadult]({filename}/images/onbeingafuckingadult.png) --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for me personally, prose is the thing i was born to. prose is the thing i
could do drunk off my ass in the middle of the night. prose is the thing i
could never seem to fuck up as completely as everything else in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but it's easy to drink all day, typing silly little poems about nothing
particularly important. it's easy to ramble on about ambiguous metaphors or
imagined slights. so i guess i thought i'd try writing something a little
more down to earth. something a little less trite. something a little more
sober. maybe it'll suck. maybe it won't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you hear that expression everywhere: "walk a mile in some else's shoes";
you've probably even repeated it one or two times yourself. but that idiom
pisses me off. i believe the author of this statement itself meant well,
yet missed the entire point: do you really need to go through the same
experiences as someone else before you are able to empathize with them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there's no possible way that you'll ever go through all, or even a significant
portion, of the experiences of just one of the myriad people you'll meet over
the course of your life. there's no way you'll be able to walk even a few feet
in another person's shoes, let alone an entire mile. so what am i getting at
here; am i saying empathy is pointless?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of course not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;empathy is by far the trait i consider the most important in regard to other
people. shit; it's by far the trait that i consider the most important in
regard to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i find the thought that you need to share someone's experiences before you
can understand someone's feelings completely maddening. i find the assumption
that you need to feel what someone feels before you can empathize with what
they feel absolutely absurd. yes, i agree it never hurts to know what it
feels like to be in someone else's shoes, but knowing how someone else is
feeling should never, ever be a prerequisite for taking it upon yourself to
understand how someone else is feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ever.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>on hubris</title><link href="https://alyp.tk/on-hubris.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-20T14:07:00-10:00</published><updated>2017-06-20T14:07:00-10:00</updated><author><name>Joey Pabalinas</name></author><id>tag:alyp.tk,2017-06-20:/on-hubris.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;a quick disclaimer:&lt;/em&gt; i am fairly young with regard to the open-source

movement, and i suppose i am also fairly young with regard to falling
out of a vagina one could argue, so keep in mind that there is a non-zero
chance that the following could just be me prancing about with some very empty
opinions that are very full of shit. so now that that's out of the way, i'll
carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now don't get me wrong here; i love the sweet ba-jeezus out of open-source
and everything it happens to stand for. my life was never quite the same after
i moved to linux full-time, and the quality of software that is available
freely still surprises me at times (though that also applies to the shit-side of
the quality spectrum.) the almost anarchistic belief in freedom that bleeds
from nearly every orifice of the open-source movement is well-intentioned at
worst, and downright valiant at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but, and it is a very large but, the community, like any group of like-minded
people collectively invested in something, does have its failings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it's subtle as fuck; unless you are deeply invested yourself in some open-source
project or group of heavy open-source users it's unlikely to be noticeable at
all. but if you are, it's inevitable that you'll start to feel stifled by a
general miasma of half-elitism/half-hubris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;let he who is without sin, eh?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but alas, i admit to being just as guilty of both of these things; a few times
you do wind up having the wisdom to back it up, but most other times you are
just fallaciously assuming that you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="knowledge" src="https://alyp.tk/images/knowledge.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of course, we don't need another blog crying about how the sun should be
rising in the west and setting in the east. a thing as abstract as hubris is
intransigent by its very nature: humanity, good/evil, ???, meretricious
philosophy, etc. i am mostly just expressing my slight curiosity about my
day to day happenstances, maybe even tossing a hail-mary or two
guessing at the "why?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is possible that the whole "free" business is a large part of it. of course
it is true that not all open-source software is free, the vast majority of it
unequivocally is. i mean people are competitive by nature. people want to be
the best, be the richest, or be the most liked. i would even venture to say that
is a large portion of what it means to be human. so we're no longer strutting
about trying to make the most money; instead, it's about being the smartest
fuck in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because let's face it; we all have some motivation for bothering to do the
things we do. we need one. otherwise why bother even waking up in the morning?
have a motive is not a bad thing at all, and neither is the commendable goal to
want to be the smartest fuck in the room. great! now i can WAIT OH SHIT—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;turns out being smart is fucking hard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then something interesting happens: turns out if you stick 20 people in a
room and have them debate some random rhetorical topic, the person who seems
the smartest is quite often simply the most confident; being the smartest is
helps of course, but it is not required at all. as they say: empty vessels
often make the most noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so now you have 19 people and 1 really confident dude who the group has
subconsciously picked as the smartest. the ironic part is that it's also
very likely the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; smartest person in the room is now second guessing
him/herself. lorem ipsum; the cycle continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the point i am trying to make here is a plea to please refrain from being just
another aimless sheeple who takes everyone and all arguments at face value.
you don't have to be a dick or an ungrateful sack of shit, (it's still possible
after all that they actually ARE the smartest person in the room,) but do
verify on your own time before accepting shit as fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it quickly starts to get easier to tell who is full of shit, (easier to tell
when you yourself are full of shit as well,) and you start to find your own
little ways to speed up checking out the accuracy of some arbitrary information
or look up some random reference fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don't be a fucking sheep. don't be an ungrateful dick. admit to yourself that
the possibility that at times you don't know shit. have the courage to recognize
those times that you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know shit. trust sparingly, doubt gratuitously,
and don't take shit so seriously; &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
