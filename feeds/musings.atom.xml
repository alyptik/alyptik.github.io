&lt;p&gt;for me personally, prose is the thing i was born to. prose is the thing i
could do drunk off my ass in the middle of the night. prose is the thing i
could never seem to fuck up as completely as everything else in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but it's easy to drink all day, typing silly little poems about nothing
particularly important. it's easy to ramble on about ambiguous metaphors or
imagined slights. so i guess i thought i'd try writing something a little
more down to earth. something a little less trite. something a little more
sober. maybe it'll suck. maybe it won't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you hear that expression everywhere: "walk a mile in some else's shoes";
you've probably even repeated it one or two times yourself. but that idiom
pisses me off. i believe the author of this statement itself meant well,
yet missed the entire point: do you really need to go through the same
experiences as someone else before you are able to empathize with them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there's no possible way that you'll ever go through all, or even a significant
portion, of the experiences of just one of the myriad people you'll meet over
the course of your life. there's no way you'll be able to walk even a few feet
in another person's shoes, let alone an entire mile. so what am i getting at
here; am i saying empathy is pointless?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of course not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;empathy is by far the trait i consider the most important in regard to other
people. shit; it's by far the trait that i consider the most important in
regard to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i find the thought that you need to share someone's experiences before you
can understand someone's feelings completely maddening. i find the assumption
that you need to feel what someone feels before you can empathize with what
they feel absolutely absurd. yes, i agree it never hurts to know what it
feels like to be in someone else's shoes, but knowing how someone else is
feeling should never, ever be a prerequisite for taking it upon yourself to
understand how someone else is feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ever.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>on hubris</title><link href="https://alyp.tk/on-hubris.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-20T14:07:00-10:00</published><updated>2017-06-20T14:07:00-10:00</updated><author><name>Joey Pabalinas</name></author><id>tag:alyp.tk,2017-06-20:/on-hubris.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;a quick disclaimer:&lt;/em&gt; i am fairly young with regard to the open-source

movement, and i suppose i am also fairly young with regard to falling
out of a vagina one could argue, so keep in mind that there is a non-zero
chance that the following could just be me prancing about with some very empty
opinions that are very full of shit. so now that that's out of the way, i'll
carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now don't get me wrong here; i love the sweet ba-jeezus out of open-source
and everything it happens to stand for. my life was never quite the same after
i moved to linux full-time, and the quality of software that is available
freely still surprises me at times (though that also applies to the shit-side of
the quality spectrum.) the almost anarchistic belief in freedom that bleeds
from nearly every orifice of the open-source movement is well-intentioned at
worst, and downright valiant at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but, and it is a very large but, the community, like any group of like-minded
people collectively invested in something, does have its failings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it's subtle as fuck; unless you are deeply invested yourself in some open-source
project or group of heavy open-source users it's unlikely to be noticeable at
all. but if you are, it's inevitable that you'll start to feel stifled by a
general miasma of half-elitism/half-hubris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;let he who is without sin, eh?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but alas, i admit to being just as guilty of both of these things; a few times
you do wind up having the wisdom to back it up, but most other times you are
just fallaciously assuming that you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="knowledge" src="https://alyp.tk/images/knowledge.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of course, we don't need another blog crying about how the sun should be
rising in the west and setting in the east. a thing as abstract as hubris is
intransigent by its very nature: humanity, good/evil, ???, meretricious
philosophy, etc. i am mostly just expressing my slight curiosity about my
day to day happenstances, maybe even tossing a hail-mary or two
guessing at the "why?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is possible that the whole "free" business is a large part of it. of course
it is true that not all open-source software is free, the vast majority of it
unequivocally is. i mean people are competitive by nature. people want to be
the best, be the richest, or be the most liked. i would even venture to say that
is a large portion of what it means to be human. so we're no longer strutting
about trying to make the most money; instead, it's about being the smartest
fuck in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because let's face it; we all have some motivation for bothering to do the
things we do. we need one. otherwise why bother even waking up in the morning?
have a motive is not a bad thing at all, and neither is the commendable goal to
want to be the smartest fuck in the room. great! now i can WAIT OH SHIT—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;turns out being smart is fucking hard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then something interesting happens: turns out if you stick 20 people in a
room and have them debate some random rhetorical topic, the person who seems
the smartest is quite often simply the most confident; being the smartest is
helps of course, but it is not required at all. as they say: empty vessels
often make the most noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so now you have 19 people and 1 really confident dude who the group has
subconsciously picked as the smartest. the ironic part is that it's also
very likely the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; smartest person in the room is now second guessing
him/herself. lorem ipsum; the cycle continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the point i am trying to make here is a plea to please refrain from being just
another aimless sheeple who takes everyone and all arguments at face value.
you don't have to be a dick or an ungrateful sack of shit, (it's still possible
after all that they actually ARE the smartest person in the room,) but do
verify on your own time before accepting shit as fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it quickly starts to get easier to tell who is full of shit, (easier to tell
when you yourself are full of shit as well,) and you start to find your own
little ways to speed up checking out the accuracy of some arbitrary information
or look up some random reference fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don't be a fucking sheep. don't be an ungrateful dick. admit to yourself that
the possibility that at times you don't know shit. have the courage to recognize
those times that you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know shit. trust sparingly, doubt gratuitously,
and don't take shit so seriously; &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
