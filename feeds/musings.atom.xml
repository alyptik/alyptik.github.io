&lt;p&gt;So why do I want to be a programmer? Why do I want to work in software development? Why do I want to spend hours in gdb trying to figure out why my program is segfaulting? Why do I want to spend most of the day reading manpages to figure out library function prototypes? Why do I want to make it nearly a certainty that I will end up with an RSI later in life; some sort of typing related horror that will probably make daily task incredibly annoying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the short and simple answer is &lt;strong&gt;because it's fun&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a joy hacking away at code, dereferencing pointers with reckless abandon, clobbering registers for the fun of it, coming up with ridiculously hacky solutions to problems that would make most normal people swoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really something I love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what makes a good programmer? The answer varies depending on who you ask of course, but ask the grizzled veterans, the ones who used to hack away on TX-01s between classes and build telephone relays to thwart service provider fees, you'll start to see the answers sort of converge; I've eventually learned that these are the ones that warrant your full, undivided attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming is hard. There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it, and really it is not some sort of thing you can do half-heartedly. Attention to detail is incredibly important. You need to be willing to put the work in; when you have a problem you can't solve no matter how hard you throw your brain pan at it, you can't just check stack overflow and copy-paste some snippet call you a programmer. Well, you can, but eventually, your hubris will catch up with you. You'll find yourself stuck way in over your head, and end up quitting and becoming a lumberjack or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, you have to actually want to know the “why”. The internet is great, answers to nearly any problem are right your fingertips, but just using someone else's work and calling it a day will eventually come back to bite you. Googling is fine and dandy, encouraged even, but you have to try to understand “why” this is the solution. By doing so, you not only are bettering your craft, you are building towards something far more important: A foundation for your entire programming career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how some tiny, useless snippet works under-the-hood, say the reason why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;putchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;prints out &lt;code&gt;'o'&lt;/code&gt; may seem useless and unimportant; who would ever need to use something like this in production? But as it turns out, this is a brick in the house you are building. Because you are aware that array indexing is just pointer math:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;when you come across some weirdo problem like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;you are then able to realize you are doing array indexing, and it's the same as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and you end up with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;without having to sort through any incredibly ugly pointer math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now having technical know-how isn't at all the only thing you need to be any good at programming; in fact, it's not even the most important trait to have. Above all, the thing that makes or breaks you is humility. You need to be humble, a person who understands that “I am probably am not some super-prodigy one-in-a-million chosen-by-god programmer who knows everything.” Having the courage to admit that “I probably need to seek out help” every now and then is incontrovertibly the most important characteristic to have; it truly is what defines a professional programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to be humble, as simple as it may seem, is NOT easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are my long-term aspirations? I have no clue. I haven't fully planned out my life apart from a general direction I have pointed myself in, and I don't really feel a pressing need to do so. I just want to be happy, spending my days hacking away at projects that tickle my fancy, creating programs others find useful; everyone wants to make some sort of mark on the world after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do want to be good at my craft, and I will not pretend I am without sin; the sins I have gone over I am guilty of committing far more than a few times. I will not apologize for being human. But I am earnestly working at it. In the end, if I were to ask myself: “Where am I going? What is it I really want to be in this unimaginably huge sea of possibilities?” Well, at this point, the only answer I can give right now would be a simple one, maybe one that would be considered a bit corny by most, but it would be something given in surety:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I just want to be a human being worth a damn.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>on being a fucking adult</title><link href="https://alyp.tk/on-being-a-fucking-adult.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-02T20:06:00-10:00</published><updated>2017-07-02T20:06:00-10:00</updated><author><name>Joey Pabalinas</name></author><id>tag:alyp.tk,2017-07-02:/on-being-a-fucking-adult.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="onbeingafuckingadult" src="https://alyp.tk/images/onbeingafuckingadult.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for me personally, prose is the thing i was born to. prose is the thing i
could do drunk off my ass in the middle of the night. prose is the thing i
could never seem to fuck up as completely as everything else in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but it's easy to drink all day, typing silly little poems about nothing
particularly important. it's easy to ramble on about ambiguous metaphors or
imagined slights. so i guess i thought i'd try writing something a little
more down to earth. something a little less trite. something a little more
sober. maybe it'll suck. maybe it won't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you hear that expression everywhere: "walk a mile in some else's shoes";
you've probably even repeated it one or two times yourself. but that idiom
pisses me off. i believe the author of this statement itself meant well,
yet missed the entire point: do you really need to go through the same
experiences as someone else before you are able to empathize with them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there's no possible way that you'll ever go through all, or even a significant
portion, of the experiences of just one of the myriad people you'll meet over
the course of your life. there's no way you'll be able to walk even a few feet
in another person's shoes, let alone an entire mile. so what am i getting at
here; am i saying empathy is pointless?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of course not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;empathy is by far the trait i consider the most important in regard to other
people. shit; it's by far the trait that i consider the most important in
regard to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i find the thought that you need to share someone's experiences before you
can understand someone's feelings completely maddening. i find the assumption
that you need to feel what someone feels before you can empathize with what
they feel absolutely absurd. yes, i agree it never hurts to know what it
feels like to be in someone else's shoes, but knowing how someone else is
feeling should never, ever be a prerequisite for taking it upon yourself to
understand how someone else is feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ever.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>on hubris</title><link href="https://alyp.tk/on-hubris.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-20T14:07:00-10:00</published><updated>2017-06-20T14:07:00-10:00</updated><author><name>Joey Pabalinas</name></author><id>tag:alyp.tk,2017-06-20:/on-hubris.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;a quick disclaimer:&lt;/em&gt; i am fairly young with regard to the open-source

movement, and i suppose i am also fairly young with regard to falling
out of a vagina one could argue, so keep in mind that there is a non-zero
chance that the following could just be me prancing about with some very empty
opinions that are very full of shit. so now that that's out of the way, i'll
carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now don't get me wrong here; i love the sweet ba-jeezus out of open-source
and everything it happens to stand for. my life was never quite the same after
i moved to linux full-time, and the quality of software that is available
freely still surprises me at times (though that also applies to the shit-side of
the quality spectrum.) the almost anarchistic belief in freedom that bleeds
from nearly every orifice of the open-source movement is well-intentioned at
worst, and downright valiant at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but, and it is a very large but, the community, like any group of like-minded
people collectively invested in something, does have its failings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it's subtle as fuck; unless you are deeply invested yourself in some open-source
project or group of heavy open-source users it's unlikely to be noticeable at
all. but if you are, it's inevitable that you'll start to feel stifled by a
general miasma of half-elitism/half-hubris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;let he who is without sin, eh?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but alas, i admit to being just as guilty of both of these things; a few times
you do wind up having the wisdom to back it up, but most other times you are
just fallaciously assuming that you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="knowledge" src="https://alyp.tk/images/knowledge.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of course, we don't need another blog crying about how the sun should be
rising in the west and setting in the east. a thing as abstract as hubris is
intransigent by its very nature: humanity, good/evil, ???, meretricious
philosophy, etc. i am mostly just expressing my slight curiosity about my
day to day happenstances, maybe even tossing a hail-mary or two
guessing at the "why?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is possible that the whole "free" business is a large part of it. of course
it is true that not all open-source software is free, the vast majority of it
unequivocally is. i mean people are competitive by nature. people want to be
the best, be the richest, or be the most liked. i would even venture to say that
is a large portion of what it means to be human. so we're no longer strutting
about trying to make the most money; instead, it's about being the smartest
fuck in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because let's face it; we all have some motivation for bothering to do the
things we do. we need one. otherwise why bother even waking up in the morning?
have a motive is not a bad thing at all, and neither is the commendable goal to
want to be the smartest fuck in the room. great! now i can WAIT OH SHIT—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;turns out being smart is fucking hard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then something interesting happens: turns out if you stick 20 people in a
room and have them debate some random rhetorical topic, the person who seems
the smartest is quite often simply the most confident; being the smartest is
helps of course, but it is not required at all. as they say: empty vessels
often make the most noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so now you have 19 people and 1 really confident dude who the group has
subconsciously picked as the smartest. the ironic part is that it's also
very likely the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; smartest person in the room is now second guessing
him/herself. lorem ipsum; the cycle continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the point i am trying to make here is a plea to please refrain from being just
another aimless sheeple who takes everyone and all arguments at face value.
you don't have to be a dick or an ungrateful sack of shit, (it's still possible
after all that they actually ARE the smartest person in the room,) but do
verify on your own time before accepting shit as fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it quickly starts to get easier to tell who is full of shit, (easier to tell
when you yourself are full of shit as well,) and you start to find your own
little ways to speed up checking out the accuracy of some arbitrary information
or look up some random reference fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don't be a fucking sheep. don't be an ungrateful dick. admit to yourself that
the possibility that at times you don't know shit. have the courage to recognize
those times that you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know shit. trust sparingly, doubt gratuitously,
and don't take shit so seriously; &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
