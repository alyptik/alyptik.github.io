Functions are abstractions, types are abstractions, classes are abstractions, even programs and programming languages themselves are nothing but abstractions. Abstractions are really the whole foundation of computing not to mention most human achievements over the course of history, really. It is a great tool to …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Joey Pabalinas</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2017 18:48:00 -1000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:alyp.tk,2017-12-22:/abstractions-will-make-your-code-sexy-again.html</guid></item><item><title>on simple code</title><link>https://alyp.tk/on-simple-code.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As I get older, I have started to notice how many of my childhood habits that I assumed had been useful and intelligent were in fact, horrible ones.

Quite simply, I find it an incredibly fun language to program in. Even through all the weird, little Heisenbugs, the segmentation faults, the incredibly confusing linker errors, it is still my favorite programming language by far. You will hear a lot of bad press about C:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why do I want to be a programmer? Why do I want to work in software development? Why do I want to spend hours in gdb trying to figure out why my program is segfaulting? Why do I want to spend most of the day reading manpages to figure …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Joey Pabalinas</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2017 22:43:00 -1000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:alyp.tk,2017-08-23:/on-dreams.html</guid></item><item><title>license and patents and stallman, oh my!</title><link>https://alyp.tk/license-and-patents-and-stallman-oh-my.html</link><description>&lt;!-- ![gpl]({filename}/images/gpl.jpg) --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Linux and open source software to death. Anyone who has moved from
Windows or Mac to this unassuming open source operating system knows exactly
why: freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh hey, I need to make a Powerpoint, but I don't actually own Microsoft
Office… Oh wait, I am on Linux and …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Joey Pabalinas</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2017 20:25:00 -1000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:alyp.tk,2017-08-08:/license-and-patents-and-stallman-oh-my.html</guid></item><item><title>just fucking do it already</title><link>https://alyp.tk/just-fucking-do-it-already.html</link><description>&lt;!-- ![justfuckingdoitalready]({filename}/images/justfuckingdoitalready.png) --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't usually like being around other people. I don't usually care
much for interacting with other people. For a long time, I sort of told myself
it was because I happened to be some sort of weirdo misanthrope, but after a
while I realized that I didn't actually hate …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Joey Pabalinas</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2017 00:38:00 -1000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:alyp.tk,2017-07-26:/just-fucking-do-it-already.html</guid></item><item><title>on being a fucking adult</title><link>https://alyp.tk/on-being-a-fucking-adult.html</link><description>&lt;!-- ![onbeingafuckingadult]({filename}/images/onbeingafuckingadult.png) --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for me personally, prose is the thing i was born to. prose is the thing i
could do drunk off my ass in the middle of the night. prose is the thing i
could never seem to fuck up as completely as everything else in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
