<p>If you search for "remove", you only get a link to the C function (to delete a file) and not the C++ algorithm. It seems both should be displayed, or there should be a way to get to the C++ one.
<a href="../User:Jaredgrubb.html" title="User:Jaredgrubb">Jaredgrubb</a> 08:30, 11 July 2013 (PDT)
</p>
<dl><dd> Yeah, this isn't optimal. We also have a similar problem with "std::move", which could refer to cpp/algorithm/move or cpp/utility/move.  It's not limited to search results, either: the automatic links in code examples have the same problem.  
</dd><dd> It might be worth thinking about a general solution to all of these problems...perhaps something like adding an optional field describing how an item should be rendered.  For example:
<ul><li> "std::move" could work as it currently does, i.e. links to cpp/algorithm/move but renders as "std::move"
</li><li> "std::move_1" could link to cpp/utility/move but would also be rendered as "std::move"

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> I chatted with Beman Dawes: He says that n3693 is very complete, but it might be wise to wait until after the Chicago meeting on 9/23-9/28, as there are some minor changes (including the choice of sub-namespace within std) that would be annoying to write and then fix.  The filesystem TS from that meeting (which will be available around 10/16) should be final. --<a href="../User:Nate.html" title="User:Nate">Nate</a> 10:37, 1 August 2013 (PDT)

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Thread_safety"> Thread safety </span></h2>
<p>Currently we include an explicit description of thread-safety of functions on only one case -- when a function is not reentrant. However, <i>any</i> data race can cause function to be thread-unsafe for particular usage. Possible data races are not obvious most of the time, thus I guess it would be a good idea to explicitly specify thread safety of all functions.
</p><p>The information on thread-safety could go to a separate section, <a href="../Help:Manual_of_style.html#Functions" title="Help:Manual of style">between the <i>complexity</i> and <i>notes</i> sections</a>. I'm a bit unsure as to what title for the section we should choose? Currently I'm thinking about simple "thread safety", though "data races" may be also a good candidate (cplusplus.com uses this one).
</p><p>Any opinions?

</p>
<dl><dd> The standard guarantees for thread safety in C++ library functions are in 17.6.4.10[res.on.objects] and 17.6.5.9[res.on.data.races]. I am not sure how meaningful that would be to repeat the text for every function, although it is definitely worthwhile to put it somewhere on the wiki. Only a handful of functions are "not required to avoid data races", which I think we've all documented, although more-or-less informally. From what I see on cplusplus.com a lot of what appears under 'Data races' there is not at all guaranteed by the standard. I wouldn't mind using BSL classification (minimally/const/fully thread-safe, thread-aware, thread-enabled), but even that would be a little boring (const-thread-safe, almost every single page). --<a href="../User:Cubbi.html" title="User:Cubbi">Cubbi</a> 07:10, 16 August 2013 (PDT)
</dd><dd> (edit) oh, yeah, also 23.2.2[container.requirements.dataraces]/1 with its list of container member functions that are const for the purposes of 17.6.5.9.. maybe it can be phrased into something helpful for individual container member functions. --<a href="../User:Cubbi.html" title="User:Cubbi">Cubbi</a> 18:07, 17 August 2013 (PDT)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> It does seem a little repetitive to have "const thread-safe" on every page. Maybe it would make sense to start by making a single high-quality page explaining the thread-safety guarantees made by the standard, and then see how much traffic it gets/how discoverable it is. If people can google up a clear answer about thread safety in the standard library, then perhaps we don't need to repeat it over and over on every page. --<a href="../User:Nate.html" title="User:Nate">Nate</a> 17:17, 19 August 2013 (PDT)

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Including_clauses_from_the_official_standard"> Including clauses from the official standard </span></h2>
<p>There are times I'd like to quickly check the C++11 standard for additional information on a topic here at cppreference. I think
including the clause number so you could quickly refer to it in the standard would be convenient.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Abandoning_complex_templates">Abandoning complex templates</span></h2>
<p>After some considerations, I arrived to the conclusion that in some places of the wiki the templates are <i>unnecessarily</i> complex and we all would be better off if we simply duplicated text. The content is mature, so the benefit of avoiding several identical edits from time to time is heavily outweighed by the fact that the new editors can't cope with the complexity. What do others think about the prospect of gradually abandoning complex "page templates", such as &#123;&#123;<a href="../Template:cpp/container/emplace_assoc.html" title="Template:cpp/container/emplace assoc">cpp/container/emplace_assoc</a>&#125;&#125; (be sure to look at its source)? --<a href="../User:P12.html" title="User:P12">P12</a> 16:45, 28 August 2013 (PDT)

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id=".22C.2B.2B_book.22:_an_educational_section_on_cppreference"> "C++ book": an educational section on cppreference </span></h2>
<p>After some discussions with <a href="../User:Nate.html" title="User:Nate">Nate</a>, we agreed that it makes sense to create a new section on Cppreference with much broader scope than the current wiki. The current policy of focusing on the C++ standard often results in documentation that is difficult to understand unless one knows lots of C++ already. By putting this complementary material into a separate section, it becomes possible to cater to novices without reducing the readability of material intended for experts.
</p><p>While there are lots of C++ resources around the internet already, we believe that Cppreference has two very important advantages: it is a wiki, and it already has a great community of professional C++ developers. This has allowed the website to achieve the completeness and accuracy it has become widely known for. We hope that with the help of the community we can maintain the high standard of quality even for vastly expanded amount of material.
</p><p>Including new content under the umbrella of Cppreference also has the benefit of the level of integration that is not otherwise possible. For example, the discovery of the new possibilities that the newly integrated <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/">Coliru</a> online compiler provides<span style="font-size:0.7em; line-height:130%">[1]</span> was a major factor that has led to this initiative. Just imagine a novice who is able to modify and run an example without the inconvenience of copy-pasting the source code and intricacies of setting up the build environment! The user experience of the basic tutorials will be much higher than what's currently available *anywhere*.
</p><p>We will not be able to implement this idea without huge help from the community. If you are interested in contributing, please mention that you can help below<span style="font-size:0.7em; line-height:130%">[2]</span>. Comments with interesting ideas are welcome.

<dl><dd> A rough sketch of what the C++ book could look line is outlined below:
<ul><li> The C++ book is maintained in a new instance of MediaWiki at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.cppreference.com/book">http://en.cppreference.com/book</a>
</li><li> NO INSANE WIKICODE TEMPLATES. If you can improve Wikipedia, you will be able to improve the C++ book too.
</li><li> The content is written mostly in prose, something like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming">C++ programming book</a> on Wikibooks.
</li><li> The scope of the C++ book - anything that can help one to become a better C++ developer.
</li><li> Overall structure is similar to one of the current wiki.
</li><li> The C++ book is organized into two or three sections ('beginner' and 'advanced' or 'beginner', 'intermediate' and 'advanced'). 
</li><li> The 'beginner' section contains the most basic content: the assumption is that before reading it the user does not know anything about C++ and programming in general. The section will teach variables, arrays, pointers, functions, some parts of the standard library, etc. etc. and a simplified introduction into templates. The subsections would be ordered in such a way, that it would be easy to read them sequentially.
</li><li> In the 'intermediate' section it is assumed that the user already knows what's in the 'novice' section. This section contains the expanded descriptions of the bulk of the standard library, plus advanced usage of templates, etc. There's no sensible subsection ordering within the section.
</li><li> The 'advanced' section contains anything that's "very complex" and/or "useful only in large projects". For example, design patterns could be explained here, etc. The intermediate and advanced sections possibly could be a single section though: any prerequisites that the user must know could be listed at the top of each page.
</li><li> Stackoverflow could probably be a good source of what and how to describe, especially the most voted answers.
</li><li> There are plenty of great articles, such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://thbecker.net/articles/rvalue_references/section_01.html">this</a>, on the internet. It would be great to collect what they say into a single place.
</li><li> A fork of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms">More C++ Idioms</a> book on Wikibooks would be good to have.
</li><li> All content of the current wiki is be covered in the C++ book. They will complement each other very well: the current wiki will describe the <i>what</i> a function, class, etc. does, whereas the C++ book will explain how to use it, pros/cons, alternative approaches, important things to consider, etc.

<dl><dd> I think it may be too much of an undertaking. Perhaps I am overly cautious because I've written programming books in real life and can look back at the amount of hard work it takes before it becomes complete enough to be useful.
</dd><dd> Looking at your points, I think you are really suggesting two books, differing by intended audience, style, and presentation:
</dd><dd>1. a new (freely-editable and peer-reviewed) online C++ tutorial
</dd><dd> that's something that the web needs, I agree (to quote the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list">Stackoverflow C++ book list</a>, "There is a reason nobody bothered to setup a similar question for online tutorials."). I occasionally consider what it would take to start one myself, but find it a much better use of my time to improve the reference here instead. Unlike the reference, which can always point back at the standard whenever someone raises a concern, any tutorial would be highly subjective, and its layout would be essentially determined by its first contributor. For example, I would of course bring up vectors and strings far ahead of arrays and pointers (like every beginner textbook listed in the SO book list does), but I'd also bring in unit tests (and introduce an early dependency on some unit test library, likely boost since I can't imagine C++ development without boost anyway). I am sure plenty of people would suggest a different presentation, reflecting their own understanding, experience or background, but it's almost impossible to revamp the structure of a tutorial once any amount of work was put in.
</dd><dd>2. a collection of intermediate-to-advanced articles on C++
</dd><dd> public-submitted C++ article repositories have been done enough times, even <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://cplusplus.com/articles">cplusplus.com maintains one</a>. One of my favorites, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b-faq?sort=votes">the Stackoverflow c++faq</a>, is even editable and quality-controlled, yet it covers only a few high-profile, frequently asked, topics. I think "All content of the current wiki" cannot be covered: the C++ library alone takes several books to explain (Josuttis, Langer/Kreft, Williams), and many parts remain unexplored even then. The way More C++ Idioms went, with discussing individual best practices, is nice to link to once in a while, but its discoverability is pretty low: the index page with idiom names says very little.
</dd><dd> I would suggest a more limited, strictly defined focus for something to start with.. but I don't have a good idea of what it could be (if I did, I'd be writing one myself!) --<a href="../User:Cubbi.html" title="User:Cubbi">Cubbi</a> (<a href="../User_talk:Cubbi.html" title="User talk:Cubbi">talk</a>) 16:34, 6 September 2013 (PDT)

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> Lots of things depend on how many editors are interested in actively helping. Seeing that so far there's very little interest generated, I concur that it indeed is necessary to limit the scope at the beginning (or either not start the project at all). But in the long term, I hope we'll be able to expand the objectives till those outlined in the original proposal -- Wikipedia was not written in a day too, but look at it now. Being a wiki is a tremendous advantage in this regard.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> Considering (2), a simple collection of articles is not the objective.

In any case, implementing (2) is off the table for now. The discussion can be postponed until we have at least some content in the C++ book, so that we see what to base the efforts on.

<dl><dd> I like the idea but if different people start writing different sections it's very likely to become more of a collection of micro-tutorials rather than a single book. In my opinion the book will need some strong guidelines on the overall structure of the book and on the layout of the single pages.  --<a href="../User:Bazzy.html" title="User:Bazzy">Bazzy</a> 13:49, 7 September 2013 (PDT)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> Given that the content is editable by everyone and can be peer reviewed, I hope that the difference between a collection of micro-tutorials and a regular book will be pretty minimal. We just need to ensure that each tutorial covers only a single subject and that there are no holes in the total subject coverage. After all, books are divided into sections covering different subjects too.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> Having said that, there might be cases where duplication is actually beneficial. For example, the same subject may be covered by several tutorials, each of which is written having  readers with vastly different levels of C++ knowledge in mind.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> I think that it makes sense to add rules on the layout only after we have some content and see what actually works best. The same is with overall structure of the book, though I have a feeling that it will be enough to discuss a few times as we probably won't need to change the structure often.

<p>Writing a whole book from scratch might be too much of an undertaking. I think it would be prudent to consider a collection of "how-to" articles that are of manageable size, e.g., "collections", "pointers and references", "strings and standard io", "ctors, movector, dtor, copytor", etc. Once a sizeable amount has been written, a single book-entity could be derived. There are plenty of C++ sources out there already, so tightly integrating this with coliru would really set it apart from the masses. A book that already uses an online editor is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/chapter5.html">Eloquent JavaScript</a> I suggested we source some inspiration there.  --<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=User:Keepsake&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Keepsake (page does not exist)">Keepsake</a> 12:21, 8 September 2013 (GMT)
</p><p>I agree with a lot of the sentiment here about the difficulties of collaboratively writing about subjective material. Writing about the C++ standard has several features that make collaboration easier:
</p>
<ol><li> The layout and organization of the standard suggests a natural structure for the writing.
</li><li> The content is easy to divide into small pieces, which allows many people to make changes independently of others.
</li><li> The standard is a "higher authority" that can be very helpful in resolving disputes.
</li></ol>
<p>I suspect that the success of a collaboratively-edited tutorial will depend on how many of these features we can provide to editors. For example, focusing on small "micro-tutorials"  would help achieve (2) and to some extent (3) (since it would minimize debate about subjective things like presentation order and deep structure). --<a href="../User:Nate.html" title="User:Nate">Nate</a> (<a href="../User_talk:Nate.html" title="User talk:Nate">talk</a>) 05:57, 8 September 2013 (PDT)

</p><p>I have actually thought this would be a useful extension to the existing cppreference content for a while now. It's handy to have a terse reference to what a function does, but sometimes that's just not enough - especially when the function really needs to work in tandem with other functions. Even a web of "see also" links just isn't good enough.
</p><p>I also don't buy most of the objections I've seen so far. "It's too much work" doesn't make sense in the context of a wiki, which is designed to be built bit-by-bit (as opposed to a traditional book, which has to be more-or-less completely built before it is useful) - a bunch of redlinks at the start of the project is hardly going to be its death-knell, and they'll be gradually filled out. The same logic applies for "the scope is too big"; it'll get done eventually, and the more useful/wanted things will just naturally get done first.
</p><p>As for "too many cooks spoil the broth", I don't see that it will be a problem if a small group of people are dedicated as "book editors", who decide the grand structure and format, while everyone else is tasked with writing content in smaller, bite-sized bits. The "book editors" could simply maintain "what we need" lists, possibly prioritized, that editors can chip away at at their own pace.
</p><p>In general, just because there's a lot to do before it's "useful", it doesn't follow that it can't or shouldn't be done. The wiki design is ideal for chipping away at a big project. As I recall, one of the wiki mantras is "be bold".

<dl><dd> The playground is a special non-permanent page that users can use to make "test" edits, and otherwise explore mediawiki functionality.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Anchored_links_idea"> Anchored links idea </span></h2>
<p>One feature of documentation that I like is being able to link directly to parts of a page. For example: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://docs.valence.desire2learn.com/res/user.html#get--d2l-api-lp-(version)-users-whoami">http://docs.valence.desire2learn.com/res/user.html#get--d2l-api-lp-(version)-users-whoami</a> . On these docs you can hover over any of the routes or data types and a backwards-P symbol will appear, linking to that element. When an anchor link is used, the associated thing is highlighted in yellow.
</p><p>What I like about this design is it is visually unobtrusive (the widgets are hidden until you hover) and yet serves a very useful function. (Use cases: "check the 3rd overload on this page", "check out the possible implementations section" --&gt; both can be made easier by just linking directly to the subject, plus a highlight.)
</p><p>I did a quick mock-up using some cppreference pages, here are two examples:
</p><p><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~j3parker/things/cppreference_anchors_mockup/vector.html#dcl_2">http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~j3parker/things/cppreference_anchors_mockup/vector.html#dcl_2</a>

</p><p>If you hover over any of the sections or any of the declarations at the top an orange backwards-P doodad will appear with a link.
</p><p>This could presumably be implemented in the global CSS + related templates.
</p><p>Do people find this interesting? I'm willing to do the work for it if desired.

<dl><dd> I think this would be a useful addition to the site. Before I looked at your demos, I assumed that you'd need to inject a bunch of &lt;a name="..."&gt; tags into the DOM at various points, but it looks like that's not the case -- can you elaborate a little bit about what kind of CSS and mediawiki template changes this would require? --<a href="../User:Nate.html" title="User:Nate">Nate</a> (<a href="../User_talk:Nate.html" title="User talk:Nate">talk</a>) 08:57, 10 December 2013 (PST)

<dl><dd><dl><dd> Headings are not templates, thus AFAIK changing their HTML representation would need changes to the MediaWiki core. In my opinion something like a simple Javascript plugin would be an approach that is both easier to implement and more maintainable. --<a href="../User:P12.html" title="User:P12">P12</a> 09:03, 10 December 2013 (PST)

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> I think anchor widgets and highlighting of headings will definitely improve the user experience. The headings are not implemented as templates though, thus we'll need a bit of Javascript that runs after page load to implement it. You can use JQuery 1.8.3.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Linking to specific overloads can be implemented similarly too. One thing to pay attention to is that the overload order and numbering is not static. The former may be changed by an editor, though that happens relatively infrequently. The latter may be changed by scripts: for example, there's an optional Javascript plugin which hides specific overloads depending on the version of the standard selected by an user using a dropdown menu. You'll need to run your script almost immediately after page load, iterate through all the overloads and add the required HTML and CSS classes.

<p>ASCII is neither a part of the language standards nor required by them, but on this site the ASCII chart is listed under the Language sections of C/C++.

<dl><dd> Yeah, it's kind of a historical artifact.

<p>Currently long examples are not very convenient, since it's not possible to see the output of code at the beginning of the example without scrolling down.

<dl><dd> I can't get to that page right now, but assuming that it is a HTML version of the standard, it's possible that we could generate our own from github.com/cplusplus/draft using something like Latex2HTML (or one of the other LaTeX -&gt; HTML translators). --<a href="../User:Nate.html" title="User:Nate">Nate</a> (<a href="../User_talk:Nate.html" title="User talk:Nate">talk</a>) 16:05, 20 February 2014 (PST)

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> Wouldn't hosting generated HTML on github be another solution? IANAL, but the github source and the resulting HTML should have the same copyright protection, so in principle it should be possible to for them to set up another repository under the C++ committee <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/cplusplus">github organization</a> umbrella and provide access to it via <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>. Of course, this means that certain amount of cooperation from the C++ committee is needed, but perhaps an accessible up-to-date HTML copy would be useful for them too as it would be much easier to spot the bugs for the outsiders. --<a href="../User:P12.html" title="User:P12">P12</a> 20:35, 21 February 2014 (PST)
