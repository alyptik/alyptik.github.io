<p>I think that this reference needs an alphabetically ordered index pages. I would create them but I am not sure if the site maintainers will accept them. If you create an index I would work on it.
</p>
<dl><dd> It is not clear to me, if you mean an alphabetical index of all pages of this website, or an alphabetical index  of all names (symbols?) in the std namespace.<br />The latter I miss myself too, and others as well (see e.g www.stackoverflow.com). I would gladly help to build such an index page! <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=User:Gemini67&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Gemini67 (page does not exist)">Gemini67</a> (<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Gemini67&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Gemini67 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 03:38, 14 October 2015 (PDT)
<dl><dd> the OP has been building <a href="cpp/index.html" title="cpp/index">that index</a>, although there were no updates since april. It is accessible directly from the main page. Personally, I think it would be more sustainable if it were using the same wordlist as our search (which is, effectively, an index file)  --<a href="./User:Cubbi.html" title="User:Cubbi">Cubbi</a> (<a href="./User_talk:Cubbi.html" title="User talk:Cubbi">talk</a>) 05:54, 14 October 2015 (PDT)
<dl><dd> Well, but this index is far from a complete list of all symbols in the std:: namespace, isn't it? What I am looking for is an index that contains (algorithm) find_if() as well as (iomanip) setfill() or (function object) bit_and etc.<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=User:Gemini67&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Gemini67 (page does not exist)">Gemini67</a> (<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Gemini67&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Gemini67 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 08:35, 15 October 2015 (PDT)

<p>It does not have the same front page as the online reference. There is no link to the C reference. It would be nice that the C reference is linked somewhere too.

<p>I would like to propose a new export type to support Learning C/C++, STL, and C++ version differences. That type is for Anki (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ankiweb.net/">https://ankiweb.net/</a>) a cross platform flashcard system.
</p><p><b>Rationale:</b>
I have been trying to catch up on my C++ vs C++11 and brush up on my C++/STL in general using Anki, and an OOP concepts deck (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2053137949">https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2053137949</a>) . The desk is  missing allot of answers, so i started adding information from my favourite source - cppreference.com.
</p><p>It struck me that a cppreference Anki deck export may be a possible solution. That is questions auto-generated from the cross reference index, (e.g. what is an rvalue). Or a special questions and answers FAQ Page, or a markup for approved questions and answers in each discussion page?. cppreference.com, has the facts of C++ at least, but not all of the the gotcha and best practice answers have questions to reference them.
</p><p>If it also generated topic filters based on C++ version, class, etc. Then i can use it to filter the cards, to only study C++14 changes for example.
</p><p>At a minimum it can be exported as tab separated for import. e.g:
</p><p><code>What is:${keyword index}&lt;tab&gt;${page keyword(s)}&lt;tab&gt;${html + css for keyword page</code>
</p>
<dl><dd> That's an interesting idea. Can you elaborate a bit on what you mean by "questions auto-generated from the cross reference index"? I'm not sure if it makes sense to add FAQ-style Q&amp;A here, given the existence of e.g. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://isocpp.org/faq">https://isocpp.org/faq</a> (which you should check out if you haven't already!), but if you can come up with some way of automatically adapting the existing content of the site to make an Anki deck that might be different. --<a href="./User:Nate.html" title="User:Nate">Nate</a> (<a href="./User_talk:Nate.html" title="User talk:Nate">talk</a>) 07:37, 11 June 2014 (PDT)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> I have been playing with it a bit today. Anki renders the cards as HTML in the interface, so i have essentially spammed the default card stylesheet with the cppreference stylesheet to keep the page formatting. It seems that every section/linkable keyword correlates to an 'answer' or concept worth remembering. The hardest part is of course generating questions. My idea (at least for a first approximation) was to generate the card/question list from the section/keyword list + context in tree. Imagine each section as a flashcard. for example:
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> <code>Q: What is: Operator Overloading (C++ Language, Expressions)</code>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> <code>Q: What is: Assignment operator (C++ Language, Expressions, Operator Overloading)</code>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> <code>Q: How do you use: std::basic_string (C++, Strings library)</code>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> Remember content repetition is a feature not a bug&#160;:). If the concept is reasonably viable, then making it smarter/better could be the next step. I would share the deck i am working on, but i have not added any (c) references to the answers, so don't feel comfortable doing so. -- <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=User:Timoc&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Timoc (page does not exist)">Timoc</a> (<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Timoc&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Timoc (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 08:26, 11 June 2014 (PDT)

<p>I think it's worth start to document the experimental standard libraries. The namespaces and header names seem to be already decided on and are unlikely to change. The following is my suggestion of how everything could be organized:
</p>
<ul><li> A new row is added to the main page just above the useful links and C++ libraries row. The libraries are listed in similar style as the libraries that have already made into the standard.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> All experimental libraries are placed under cpp/experimental/*, where * identifies the library, e.g. fs for filesystem, optional for optional, etc.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Since the <code>std::experimental</code> namespace is long and some libraries are put into children namespaces, we won't be able to consistently follow our policy of always qualifying all names. I suggest to relax it; a full proposal is below.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> All dcl items will have markers like <span class="t-mark">(filesystem TS)</span>. We may even want to make links from them to a description somewhere.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The specification always follows the most recent draft (unless the draft is ratified in some way).
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Once the functionality is included into the standard, we add a second description of all functionality. A notice is added to the old pages: "The functionality was included into C++XX with the following changes: XX, YY, ZZ". This separation would reduce the clutter on the new standard. While the same can be said about changes between standards, I expect that much fewer people will be interested in changes between the standard and experimental specifications.

<dl><dd> This sounds reasonable. My only concern is that the TS items could be confused with standard items, but I suspect that can be addressed with appropriate visual cues.

<p>Inclusion of experimental libraries will result in some components that have very long fully qualified names, e.g. <code>std::experimental::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator</code> (extreme case). This makes following our policy of always qualifying all names not practical to follow consistently. 
</p><p>Also, one of the original reasons for full qualifications will disappear in the near future. I'm developing a new syntax highlighting plugin that will correctly make links to names even without qualification. So even the <code>std::</code> prefix will become not strictly needed for practical purposes.
</p><p>My proposal is as follows:
</p>
<ul><li> The page title will carry fully qualified name as before
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Examples and "possible implementation" sections will contain qualified names (possibly using namespace aliases) as before.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Any other uses (including declaration in dcl items) will use unqualified names.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> At the beginning this relaxation will only apply for the experimental features. Once the new syntax highlighting plugin goes live we can remove the <code>std::</code> prefixes too.
</li></ul>

<dl><dd> I think having syntax highlighting for shortened names will be great for long names like your recursive_directory_iterator example. How about we begin by using shortened names in new content when they would otherwise be awkward and see how it looks? (It's less clear to me how much of a win it would be to change e.g. std::vector to vector.) --<a href="./User:Nate.html" title="User:Nate">Nate</a> (<a href="./User_talk:Nate.html" title="User talk:Nate">talk</a>) 21:34, 4 March 2014 (PST)

<p>I'm thinking of adding a section to each container saying under what circumstances the iterators are being invalidated. Currently, this information is only available under the specific operations, and getting a global view is difficult. Iterator invalidation is one of the most confusing aspects of working with STL, and this will, I think, make it much clearer. <a href="./User:Shachar.html" title="User:Shachar">Shachar</a> (<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Shachar&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Shachar (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 23:26, 1 April 2014 (PDT)

<p>We are thinking about enabling the <a href="./Special:Preferences.html#mw-prefsection-gadgets" title="Special:Preferences">standard revisions gadget</a> by default for all users. This will alter the way information is displayed relatively significantly, thus it's worth to discuss with the cppreference users before implementing the changes.
</p><p>Standard revisions gadget basically does a single thing: hides information that is not applicable to a certain standard version selected by user. Such tool becomes more and more necessary as the number of C++ standard revisions grows; the readability of part of the documentation is already reduced (e.g. <a href="cpp/container/vector/insert.html" title="cpp/container/vector/insert">here</a>).
</p><p>In the current plans, the standard revision gadget will work as follows:
</p>
<dl><dd><ul><li> The user may select the default standard revision he prefers (see the following mockups: <a href="http://upload.cppreference.com/mwiki/images/f/f1/stdrev-default.png" class="internal" title="stdrev-default.png"> options collapsed</a>, <a href="http://upload.cppreference.com/mwiki/images/d/d1/stdrev-expanded.png" class="internal" title="stdrev-expanded.png"> options expanded</a>, <a href="http://upload.cppreference.com/mwiki/images/c/cc/stdrev-no_js.png" class="internal" title="stdrev-no js.png"> no javascript</a>). The setting is displayed in a new collapsible options section on the heading.
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><ul><li> This can be overridden by a separate 'standard revision' menu that we already show. If non-default revision is selected, a HTTP GET parameter is appended to the URL. All links are modified to preserve the standard revision override. The override can be easily cleared via a button. There are keyboard shortcuts to select a standard revision override.
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><ul><li> Depending on the values of the default standard revision setting and standard revision override, unnecessary information is hidden. It's already possible to try this by enabling the standard revisions gadget in the <a href="./Special:Preferences.html#mw-prefsection-gadgets" title="Special:Preferences">preferences</a>. Note that the gadget hasn't been completely finished yet.
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>
<p>The above should work in the following use cases:
</p>
<dl><dd><ul><li> User wants to link to the documentation for specific standard. He selects a standard revision in the menu and pastes the contents of his URL bar somewhere. For example: http://en.cppreference.com/cpp/container/vector/insert?std=cxx11.
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><ul><li> User browses the internet and finds a link to the documentation of specific standard. He clicks it and the correct documentation is displayed. Personal preference is temporarily overridden (but only on that tab). The user can continue to browse or exit to his preferred documentation any time by clicking a button.
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><ul><li> The user wants to temporarily browse the documentation of standard that is different than his preferred, but doesn't want to affect other tabs. He simply selects the standard from the menu.
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><ul><li> User uses a specific standard for most of his work. He wants that the preferred standard is selected automatically whenever he comes to cppreference.com from the results page of some search engine. He selects the default/preferred standard revision.
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><ul><li> Users without Javascript will have the same experience as now.

<p>This is related to the "disappearing text problem" noted above, though I think it deserves a separate entry since it's not quite the same as the description at the top of that section. When viewing the site using Safari (e.g. Safari 7.0.6 (9537.78.2)), I usually observe the following: first, much of the site's layout appears, but with no text visible. After a few seconds, the text then loads. I strongly suspect this is due to the use of custom font faces, since, for example, big-O complexity text shows up right away. For what it's worth, the same thing also happens for me on Chrome (37.0.2062.94 on Mac), and it seems to be exacerbated by slow network connections. <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=User:Sdt&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Sdt (page does not exist)">Sdt</a> (<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Sdt&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Sdt (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:06, 8 September 2014 (PDT)

<dl><dd>Thank you for comprehensive answer, Cubbi!  Actually I was interested to request pages that 1) will explain some concepts of С++ (e.g. "incomplete type") or 2) will give advices on patterns (e.g. "copy and swap idiom").

As every standard language concept, it should be featured under cpp/language (in my opinion). I agree that discoverability of core language concepts is poor.

<dl><dd> We started using a custom search engine instead of a fulltext search because the fulltext search yielded somewhat noisy results. I think the idea was to optimize for specific queries like "std::vector" as opposed to more freeform queries like "undefined behavior"...so the search box would be more of a replacement for a table of contents, rather than what we normally expect from search.
</dd><dd> That being said, there is definitely room for improvement. It's possible that we could fall back to a fulltext search if the custom search doesn't return any results, for example. --<a href="./User:Nate.html" title="User:Nate">Nate</a> (<a href="./User_talk:Nate.html" title="User talk:Nate">talk</a>) 11:27, 20 December 2014 (PST)

<p>Hi All,
</p><p>As writtent in article&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="cpp/language/template_parameters.html">http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/template_parameters</a>
</p><p>Template non-type arguments
The following limitations apply when instantiating templates that have non-type template parameters:
</p><p>For integral and arithmetic types, the template argument provided during instantiation must be a converted constant expression of the template parameter's type (so implicit conversion applies).
For pointers to objects, the template arguments have to designate the address of an object with static storage duration and a linkage (either internal or external), or a constant expression that evaluates to the appropriate null pointer or std::nullptr_t value.
For pointers to functions, the valid arguments are pointers to functions with linkage (or constant expressions that evaluate to null pointer values).
For lvalue reference parameters, the argument provided at instantiation cannot be a temporary, an unnamed lvalue, or a named lvalue with no linkage (in other words, the argument must have linkage).
For pointers to members, the argument has to be a pointer to member expressed as &amp;Class::Member or a constant expression that evaluates to null pointer or std::nullptr_t value.
In particular, this implies that string literals, addresses of array elements, and addresses of non-static members cannot be used as template arguments to instantiate templates whose corresponding non-type template parameters are pointers to data.
</p><p>So couldn't clearly understand why string literal cannot be used as template argument. As I know string literal has static storage duration and internal linkage.
</p><p>Thanks Vahagn.
</p>
<dl><dd> It would be more appropriate to ask on <a href="cpp/language/template_parameters.html" title="cpp/language/template parameters">that page</a>'s <a href="./Talk:cpp/language/template_parameters.html" title="Talk:cpp/language/template parameters">Talk page</a>. Perhaps it needs a clarification, but a string literal converted to a pointer results in the address of some unnamed char object, not in the address of any object with linkage. In any case, C++17 now explicitly bans string literals. --<a href="./User:Cubbi.html" title="User:Cubbi">Cubbi</a> (<a href="./User_talk:Cubbi.html" title="User talk:Cubbi">talk</a>) 13:51, 28 December 2014 (PST)

<p>The project seems to be dead. This might be because it doesn't seem to be linked from here, and book's recent changes seem to be independent from the "main wiki"'s recent changes.
</p><p>But articles from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.cppreference.com/book/">http://en.cppreference.com/book/</a> come up in google. For example, googling "uninitialized value cppreference" brings up <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.cppreference.com/book/uninitialized">http://en.cppreference.com/book/uninitialized</a> as the third result. And since the project seems to be dead, any errors, inaccuracies, obsoletisms are unlikely to be corrected. The project's main page explicitly claims the wiki is in alpha stage, so such problems are likely to occur regularly.
</p><p>For example, the aforementioned <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.cppreference.com/book/uninitialized">http://en.cppreference.com/book/uninitialized</a> claims that "<i>Reading the value of an uninitialized variable is undefined behaviour</i>". This seems to be a gross oversimplification. I'm not an expert, so I'm not sure, but according to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/11965368/4385532">http://stackoverflow.com/a/11965368/4385532</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/25074258/4385532">http://stackoverflow.com/a/25074258/4385532</a> the situation is far more complex. I complained about this problem on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.cppreference.com/book/Talk:uninitialized">http://en.cppreference.com/book/Talk:uninitialized</a> but since the project seems to be dead, and its recent changes are independent from the main wiki's recent changes… well… I think I might have not written this message at all as well.
</p><p>If I were you, I'd either merge <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.cppreference.com/book/">http://en.cppreference.com/book/</a> with the main wiki (merge the projects' recent changes and put links to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.cppreference.com/book/">http://en.cppreference.com/book/</a> in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="index.html">http://en.cppreference.com/w/</a>) in the hope that the book project receives some attention or go ahead and delete it at all. Depending on whether <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.cppreference.com/book/">http://en.cppreference.com/book/</a> has any information that might be useful.

<p>Does anyone have strong feelings about the usefulness of the non-english subsites?
</p><p>I've gotten a non-trivial amount of feedback from non-english speakers saying that the autotranslated content on those sites is at best useless (it's not very readable and quickly falls out of sync with the english-language content) and at worst disruptive (it can contaminate search results, making it harder for good results to bubble to the top).
</p><p>People have been making changes to the non-english subsites, but at a very low rate compared to the english site. I don't like the idea of throwing out the translation work that people have done, but at some point the costs may outweigh the benefits.

<dl><dd> This is a fair point. I think the original idea might have been an interest in avoiding a situation where we show too many technical details up front, possibly interfering with the presentation of more important information.
