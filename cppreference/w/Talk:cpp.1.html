<p>I've been wanting a site like this, and I'm sure many people, including myself, would absolutely love to contribute.  But the templates used make the job really difficult.  Would anybody be upset If I just started adding stuff in non-template form, and someone else could come along later and templatize it?  Or myself if I care to learn it more in depth.
</p>
<dl><dd> The templates here are a bit complex.  (The idea was that the content of this site has a fair amount of repetition and hierarchy, and templates allow that stuff to be specified in one place rather than repeated in multiple locations.  But it does make for a steep learning curve.)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <b>I think it would be fine if you added non-templated content</b>.  After you've made changes, others can come along and apply formatting and refactoring as needed.  
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> If there are any specific parts of the templating scheme that don't make sense, please mention them.  It might make sense to put together a short tutorial describing how the templates work, and it would be useful to know what the overview should cover.
</dd></dl>
<p>First question.  Is this how discussions are done, by just continuously editing the Talk:cpp page? Then I suppose we click the signature button to indicate we're done talking.
</p><p>Some of the things that are confusing are things like dcl and tdcl.  I guess they are used to make lists, but I have no idea what those acronyms stand for, or what the difference between the two is.  There are other things I saw, I can't remember where, something like ltt.  I would like an explanation for any acronyms like that.  Thanks.

</p><p>Hi all,
</p><p>I'm the original contributor of the content in this wiki. Previously I have extensively edited the content in the old wiki that was based on Dokuwiki CMS. During that time I had a lot of discomfort with repetitive modifications to the stuff that was duplicated across several places. It was quite time consuming too, as, for example, some function descriptions are used in 20+ places. So I decided to pass all the iterative work to the templates. The resulting system is quite complex, I agree. However, the formatting capabilities are far, far higher when using templates, and since the content is created once, but consumed many times, I think that the improved usability is worth the additional cost writing the material.
</p><p>All templates have their documentation at Template:&lt;template name&gt;, e.g. <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=Template:tdcl_list_item&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:tdcl list item (page does not exist)">Template:tdcl list item</a>. There is no page that summarizes all templates though, however since there is demand for one, I will create it soon at <a href="./Help:Templates.html" title="Help:Templates">Help:Templates</a>.
</p><p>Regarding the discussions, I think it's a good idea to write signature below each comment. Alternatively, one can just write <tt>~~~~</tt> which is automatically translated to signature. 
</p><p><a href="./User:P12.html" title="User:P12">P12</a> 05:00, 1 July 2011 (PDT)
</p><p>As C++ programmers, I'm sure everybody can appreciate the power afforded by templates.  I didn't know about the documentation for the individual templates.  That's helpful, thanks.

<p>This site seems to be laid out in the categories documented in the standard library, sort of.  But it's not entirely consistent in that.  Should effort be made to that effect?  So, we would have 13 broad categories, starting with the Language Support Library, and ending with the Thread Support Library.  In that same vein, I think should be done to disambiguate the General Utilities Library from the utility header.  For example, vector is part of the Containers Library, and this is reflected in it's page's name cpp/container/vector.  But the memory header is part of the General Utilities Library, and that is not reflected in it's page's name cpp/memory.  However, I think that cpp/utility/memory would not be good as that would cause people to confuse it with the utility header.  I think cpp/general_utilities/memory would be the appropriate name for it.  Thoughts?

<dl><dd> The problem is that the Standard groups its components into libraries based only on their functionality. It works well for most of the components that serve very specific purpose. However, for the most generic libraries, components with similar objective are placed into different libraries. This decreases the usability a lot, so we chose not to mirror the structure of the Standard in these cases. It turned out, that the problematic libraries are the [18] Language Support library, [19] Diagnostics library and [20] General Utilities library. So for these libraries, different partitioning scheme is used (the component numbers are based on doc no. N3291):

<dl><dd>Hierarchically, all these components are in <a href="cpp/utility.html" title="cpp/utility">cpp/utility</a> (sidebars should reflect that too). However, some of them are not in cpp/utility URL-wise because that would be confusing as some components are, well, not general utilities (e.g. <a href="cpp/memory.html" title="cpp/memory">cpp/memory</a>, <a href="cpp/error.html" title="cpp/error">cpp/error</a>, <a href="cpp/chrono.html" title="cpp/chrono">cpp/chrono</a>). I don't know why function objects are at <a href="cpp/functional.html" title="cpp/functional" class="mw-redirect">cpp/functional</a>.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>One thing that I'm thinking about is to group <i>Basic types</i>, <i>Runtime type information</i> and <i>Metaprogramming/type traits</i> together as they are <i>all</i> about type properties.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> By the way, the section names <i>memory</i>, <i>utility</i>, etc. are named after the headers only because it is easier to remember the paths then. They have little to do with the actual content that is placed into these categories. E.g. <a href="cpp/memory.html" title="cpp/memory">cpp/memory</a> hosts contents of the <i>new</i> header at <a href="cpp/memory/new.1.html" title="cpp/memory/new">cpp/memory/new</a>.<a href="./User:P12.html" title="User:P12">P12</a> 12:55, 2 July 2011 (PDT)

<dl><dd><dl><dd> Could we promote pair and tuple to front page under Utility? I think they should be listed similar to how bitset is listed now. --<a href="./User:Cubbi.html" title="User:Cubbi">Cubbi</a>

<dl><dd> Unfortunately, these things are currently out of scope of this wiki. The general concepts are best covered not here, but on Wikipedia, because any article there benefits more people. Also, if a subject is appropriate for them, they will have an article on it eventually, so there's no point to extend this wiki with information that will be duplicated on Wikipedia in the future. Also, I think we don't want to become a manual of each existing C++ compiler - their own documentation is for that.

</p>
<dl><dd> I think the idea of a C reference is an interesting idea, but there are a couple of things that we should probably get some discussion on, just to make sure that we're all on the same page.  I assume we'd target C11?  How should the C++ side of the site refer (if at all) to the C side?  C++11 references C99 (?) but there are some differences, e.g. header file names, no?  Also, in terms of unleashing this on the world, it might make sense to try to get the overall structure of the content figured out before making it too public -- search engines can react poorly to large chunks of content moving, and we don't want people to e.g. accidentally waste time duplicating content. <a href="./User:Nate.html" title="User:Nate">Nate</a> 14:53, 13 April 2012 (PDT)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> Looking from a practical perspective, there's not much difference between whether we target C99 or C11. The C99 reference is already essentially written, one just needs to change the perspective from C++ to C. Given that we'll eventually accept C11 anyway, I see no problems with having it now. 
</dd><dd> Regarding the differences between C99 as included in C++ and the real C99, there shouldn't be any problems. We already refer to C++ not as a superset of C, but as a different language, although similar. Some coupling could be kept by adding links to <i>see also</i> sections where appropriate. I'd like to avoid adding links anywhere else, otherwise it would be very hard to make separate archives for C and C++ references then.
</dd><dd> The overall structure of the C reference in my opinion is good already. It's very similar to the C++ counterpart and it would be good idea to preserve that similarity, unless there is good reason not to. That said, I too would like to wait some time, 'until the dust settles'. Maybe there's something I've missed. -- <a href="./User:P12.html" title="User:P12">P12</a> 18:48, 13 April 2012 (PDT)

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> Okay, I'm starting to see how this could work.  I was a bit worried about the crosstalk between the C++ and C sites (e.g. the change to fwscanf that was reverted) but limiting it to a few "see alsos" here and there should work well.  After looking at it a bit, there are plenty of differences between C-ish content on the C++ site and what we would want as content for the pure C site, but those differences aren't structural.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> Maybe one more aspect of crosstalk is template support (which you already seem to be playing around with a bit, P12) -- is it worth trying to share any mediawiki templates between C++ and C? <a href="./User:Nate.html" title="User:Nate">Nate</a> 05:28, 14 April 2012 (PDT)
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> Most of the MediaWiki templates are language agnostic and can be reused without problems. The only exceptions are templates related to syntax highlighting and marks (e.g. <span class="t-mark-rev t-since-c99">(since C99)</span>), but they already have support for C. The syntax highlighting templates will even automatically select proper language based on in which section - c/* or cpp/* - the page resides. One thing worth noting is that the templates themselves don't increase coupling between any parts of the wiki, so they can be used liberally.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> By the way, I though a bit about how we could add the C reference to the front page when we decide to do so.

<p>I would suspect that this has been discussed before and the FAQ points out that no tutorial style introductions should be added to the reference manual.

<p>There is a lot of quality content scattered throughout the net on those topics (stackoverflow.com, wikipedia, wiki-books) and of course general literature, but wouldn't it be nice to have it in an aggregated form that gets some exposure by people that care?

<dl><dd> That's an interesting idea.

<dl><dd> I was thinking along the lines of the wikibooks page. The benefit would be to have the ability to link to the reference and keep things in a closed environment and have control over the pages (and the guarantee that they don't disappear). If I would write about a modern implementation of d-pointers using std::unique_ptr I would like to reference it or any of its members. A page for an idiom would consists of an introduction including common names, motivation, example use cases, an example implementation and reference material. <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=User:Pmr&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Pmr (page does not exist)">pmr</a> 05:41, 18 April 2012 (PDT)
<dl><dd> I think your vision could still be implemented in Wikibooks. As opposed to Wikipedia, Wikibooks doesn't have any policies that discourage linking to external websites, so there's nothing that prevents linking to this wiki liberally. Similarly, nothing prevents linking to <i>More C++ Idioms</i> book from this wiki. I'd say it's possible to achieve the same degree of coupling between this reference and the <i>More C++ Idioms</i> book as if they were in the same wiki. 
</dd><dd> The Wikibooks option has, in my opinion, quite strong advantages. It's a good resource already, extensively covering many idioms. It would take a lot of effort to produce content that is at least as complete. Even if we could do that, our idioms section would be quite similar to the book. The question arises - what added value would we offer? What benefit would be for a reader to choose us instead of the book? If we can't do that, we will just contribute to the existing fragmentation. Note, that the book already attracts a lot of readers and editors and is quite visible to the internet by being the first entry returned by Google for relevant queries. Thus I think it's a better target for improvement.
</dd><dd>I agree that there are several downsides with using Wikibooks. There's more bureaucracy there. The contributions of new editors are reviewed before being shown (it's easy to become 'trusted' user though). The existing format of the book may not fit your vision. Some editors might oppose huge changes even though they would accept if the same changes were made gradually. However, I think the advantages still outweigh the disadvantages. -- <a href="./User:P12.html" title="User:P12">P12</a> 07:56, 18 April 2012 (PDT)

Mixing the two would only be a distracting at best. Even though C and C++ are similar, they already have quite a lot of differences. They are unfortunately slowly diverging; C, as defined by C11, is hardly a subset of C++. Because of that, I don't think there's a way we could have single reference for both C and C++.
